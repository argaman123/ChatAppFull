# Chat app

### TODO:

- Encrypt passwords in angular too
- Scroll down properly every time a message is sent
- Reconfirm passwords (both in register and in the change password modal)
- Remind the user to renew in 2 days (for one-month) and let him know that his plan was renewed automatically (for subscription)
- Let the user know why his message wasn't sent (respond to send)
- Login and register pages as modals instead
- Buy premium directly from the register page
-  ? Don't allow opening the chat in more than one window (maybe check current online users)
